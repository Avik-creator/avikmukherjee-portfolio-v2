## Introduction:

So, in 2024 I planned to do a learn a lot of things but due to my lazy ass I couldn't complete all of them. Some of them were: 


**1.Starting DevOPS**: Wanted to Learn about DevOPS field mainly Kubernetes and Jenkins(Did it at the last phase of 2024).

**2.Going in Depth**: I wanted to upskill myself more into the field I am currently in which is Web Development.

**3.Venture in Mobile Development**: Wanted to venture into Swift and SwiftUI for understanding how IOS development work.


And many more but due one excuse or the other I couldn't fulfill it. 


## Why I couldn't do all the things that I wanted to do?

So as said above I am really a lazzy ass guy who had big goals but didnt achieved it. I stated late in various things but learning is one department where I really suck untill I am not underhuge pressure, I generally dont do that much learning or sometimes if something motivates me then I start the learning again. 

I could blame all this on college but let's be honest it doesn't take that much time to make me derailed completely. I could blame this on exam but as said the reason mentioned above. 


## So what I decided to do this Year?

So, at the first day of 2025, I decided to take **responsibility**. Rather than blaming or excusing I would like to take responsibilty, and learn things that I am planning to learn this year. 

This site will be my commitment to me that  I will learn things that I have decided to learn this year and will update it with I am learning in the current weeks as well.
