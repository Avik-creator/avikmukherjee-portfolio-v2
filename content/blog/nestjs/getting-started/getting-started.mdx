## Introduction

### Is NestJS same as NodeJS? 
Simple Answer, it is a framework built on top of NodeJS, providing a `structured` and `opinionated` approach to building backend services using JavaScript as the language of choice. 

#### Is NestJS vs ExpressJS and why I think industry is starting to move from Express?
To answer this question, we need to understand that NestJS follows `(MVC) Model-View-Controller` patterns while in Express it doesnt follow any specific patterns even though we can follow one as Express is quite `unopinionated`. Also through NestJS, we can make highly scalable backend services using the Microservices architecture which might take some overhead in setting it up in ExpressJS.  Ultimately, NestJS is preferable for those who want a well-organized, scalable application, while Express is better suited for minimal and highly customizable setups. But fun fact, it uses Express under the hood. 

#### What needs to be known in advance to move forward?
We need to know `TypeScript` and `OOP` along with `FP (Functional Programming)` and `FRP (Functional Reactive Programming)`. 

## Installation

```zsh
    npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

The above command will install `nestjs` CLI globally to help us start the nextjs project with ease.

Now to create the new nest project we need to run the command:

```zsh
    nest new <your-program-name>                        # Example: nest new rest-api
```
After running the command you will be prompted to select the package manager. You can choose your favorite, in my case I chose `pnpm`. After selecting your package manager, the initial files that will be created are shown below:

## Let's go in Depth

Now, let's open the main.ts file, in there you will see the following code:

File `main.ts`:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  await app.listen(process.env.PORT ?? 3000);
}
bootstrap();
```
Now, this is the entry point of the whole application that we are going to create in NestJS.

File `app.module.ts`:
```typescript 
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
Now this is the root module of our application and it shows that it has already added AppController for our application

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from './app.service';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get()
  getHello(): string {
    return this.appService.getHello();
  }
}
```

as well as the `app.controller.spec.ts` which contains all the test cases that we might write for our controller.


File `app.service.ts`:
```typescript 
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```

The flow of the NestJS application starts with `main.ts`, which serves as the entry point. It initializes the application using `NestFactory.create(AppModule)`, creating an instance of the app. The `AppModule` acts as the root module, registering controllers and providers to manage the applicationâ€™s structure. Within the module, `AppController` handles incoming HTTP requests, defining routes and linking them to appropriate methods. When a request is received, such as a `GET /` request, the controller calls the corresponding method in `AppService`, which contains the business logic. The service processes the request and returns data, such as a simple `Hello World!` response, which is then sent back to the client. This modular architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns, making the application scalable and maintainable.

#### Running the Application

To run the application, we can use the following command:
 ```zsh
pnpm run dev
 ```
which would run the application at `localhost:3000` in your system. Now if do a get request using `postman` or `thunderClient` to the route `localhost:3000`, then you will get `"Hello World"` back in response. 


#### How to add our own module to the application?

Now, remember in the beginning we installed the NestCLI, that would be highly helpful in this scenario. To create the module, we need to run the following command:

```zsh
nest g module <module_name>  # Example: nest g module users
```

After running the command we will see inside the `src` directory, we will see a `users` folder which will contain, `users.module.ts`. But quite an intesting thing will take place in `app.module.ts`

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { UsersModule } from './users/users.module';

@Module({
  imports: [UsersModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
If you observe carefully, in the imports which was empty before now has `UsersModule` that we created just now, which is creating the link from the parent in this case `app.module.ts` to the child `users.module.ts`.

#### How to create controller for the module we created?

To create the controller for the module you created in this case it would be `users` module, we run the following command:

```zsh
nest g controller <controller_name>  # Example: nest g controller users
```

which in turn will create `users.controller.ts` and `users.controller.spec.ts` in the users directory.

#### How to create service for the module we created?

To create the service for the module you created in this case it would be `users` module, we run the following command:

```zsh
nest g service <controller_name>  # Example: nest g service users
```

which in turn will create `users.service.ts` in the users directory.


By running the above commands we have a complete module for our users.

## Conclusion

In this blog, we've covered the basics of setting up a NestJS project, understanding its file structure, and creating our own custom modules, controllers, and services. We also learned that the modular architecture of NestJS, which divides the application into modules, controllers, and services, makes it easy to scale and manage as the application grows. In the next phase, we will dive deeper into implementing routing logic and the associated business logic to handle requests efficiently.
