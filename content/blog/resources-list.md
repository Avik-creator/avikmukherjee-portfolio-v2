## Introduction:

So, this year as said in my previous post, I am planning to learn things that I was not able to do in 2024 due to the reasons stated there. So, in this post, I am listing down the topics that I am planning to learn as well as from where I am planning to learn it from. I hope that this post will be helpful to all of you if you are planning to learn the same.  


## List of Topics, Reasons for Learning and the links of the learning resources

| Topic Name  | Reason for Learning | Resource Link |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Spring Boot            |   Always known Java but only used it for DSA, but now wanting to deep dive into the backend framework of java.                  | [Lovepreet Singh Bhaiya](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7CBVLpg0zqf_ggig9cOr72oZNGf9RZmZ&si=NLHshmGmWfDiEAug)             |
|  NestJS           |       It is quite in hype due to it's feature of providing us the ability to create microservices at ease using JS as our backend language              |        [Dave Gray](https://youtu.be/8_X0nSrzrCw)      |
|   Kubernetes          |  I wanted to learn Kubernetes in 2024, but I am doing it in 2025 so that I can deploy my applications in a production environment and keep my projects running smoothly.               |     [Tech Tutorial with Piyush](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl4APkPHzsUUOkOv3i62UidrLmSB8DcGC&si=HdwJOg1nsTUReR8b)         |
|   RAG Based Application (Langchain)       |  Obviously it is in trend to learn about this as most of the applications are currently using it to create AI based Rag Applications.            |     [FreeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/sVcwVQRHIc8), [FreeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/HSZ_uaif57o), [Harish Neel](https://youtu.be/at6XrRRdOQo)        |
|   IOS App Development       |  Always wanted to enter into app development mainly into IOS.            |     [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-dive-ios-16-swiftui-programming/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING), [Udemy - Kenneth Jones](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING)        |


## Plan to Complete

 1. At First Planning to complete NestJS and make one project using it so that I can get a good grasp of it and can make applications in the future. 
 2. RAG will be done mainly because I am looking to gasp the concepts behind it and make a simple application using that concept. 
 3. Kubernetes Needs to be continued but with a twist, as I will be using [Podman](https://podman.io/) while following the tutorial. 
 4. Then planning to learn about Spring Boot / IOS App Development. 

In the meanwhile, when I will be free, will be following [Applied OS](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7CBVLpg0zqfIdcwDNa5c2xbhvK4crNqc&si=Oq7HUaF-hGWHx7fK) or Studying for Upcoming Higher studies Exams, or make some projects which interests me or Team Siksha's Sessions.  

Will be `Starting after 17th of Feburary after our Semester Exams are over.` 

Also I am looking forward to write articles on what I learned regarding that topics so that it can serve as notes to me, when I am looking to revise it.
